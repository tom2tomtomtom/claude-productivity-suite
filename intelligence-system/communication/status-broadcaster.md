## Communication Modes

### Verbose Mode (Learning/Debug)
Full transparency with detailed explanations:
```
🔍 Analyzing request: "add user authentication"
   ├── 📊 Request complexity: Medium (confidence: 92%)
   ├── 🎯 Best system: Agent-OS (planning) → Codebase-OS (implementation)
   ├── 🧠 Pattern match: Found 3 similar implementations
   ├── 💾 Memory recall: React + JWT pattern (used in 12 projects)
   └── ⚡ Estimated efficiency: 67% faster than baseline
```

### Standard Mode (Balanced)
Clear updates without overwhelming detail:
```
🚀 Claude Intelligence System: Adding user authentication
   ├── 🎯 Using proven React + JWT pattern
   ├── 🧠 Learning from 12 similar projects
   └── ⚡ 67% efficiency boost detected
```

### Minimal Mode (Expert/Flow)
Brief, non-intrusive updates:
```
🎯 Intelligence: Auth pattern applied • 67% boost • Learning ON
```
