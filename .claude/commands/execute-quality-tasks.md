# Execute Quality Tasks

Work through code quality improvement tasks generated by analyze-codebase.

## Overview

This command helps you systematically work through quality improvement tasks:
- Reads tasks from .claude-suite/quality/*/tasks.md
- Guides you through each subtask
- Updates progress tracking
- References standards and best practices

## Usage

```
/execute-quality-tasks
```

Then specify:
- Which task to work on (or continue current)
- Whether to auto-commit after each subtask

## Task Execution Flow

1. **Load Current Tasks**
   - Find most recent analysis
   - Show task progress
   - Identify next task

2. **Execute Subtasks**
   - Show subtask requirements
   - Reference relevant standards
   - Guide implementation
   - Verify completion

3. **Update Progress**
   - Check off completed items
   - Update progress.md
   - Calculate new metrics

4. **Commit Changes**
   - Group related changes
   - Reference task in commit
   - Update documentation

## Example Session

```
> /execute-quality-tasks

Current Tasks (@.claude-suite/quality/2024-01-15-analysis/tasks.md):
- [ ] 1. Fix Security Vulnerabilities (6 subtasks)
- [â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘] 2. Resolve Critical Bugs (3/6 done)
- [ ] 3. Improve Code Quality (8 subtasks)

Continue with Task 2.4? [Y/n]

Task 2.4: Add regression tests
Reference: @~/.claude-suite/standards/best-practices.md#testing

[Implementation guided by standards...]

âœ… Task 2.4 complete! 
Progress: Task 2 now 4/6 complete (66%)

Commit changes? [Y/n]
```

## Integration

Works with:
- `/analyze-codebase` - Generates tasks
- `/monitor-quality` - Tracks improvements
- `/clean-codebase` - Implements fixes

## Best Practices

1. **Work in Order**: Complete critical tasks first
2. **Finish Subtasks**: Complete all subtasks before moving on
3. **Test Everything**: Each task should maintain working code
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Celebrate Progress**: Check progress.md regularly!
