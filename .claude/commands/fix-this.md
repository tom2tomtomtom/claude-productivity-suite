# Fix This - Intelligent Error Resolution

## Your Request
Fix the current issue: $ARGUMENTS

## AI Instructions

You are an AI that automatically detects and fixes errors in projects. Follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Error Detection
- Check for compilation/build errors
- Look for runtime errors in logs
- Identify broken functionality
- Check for dependency issues
- Validate configuration files

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- Understand the underlying problem
- Identify cascading effects
- Determine optimal fix approach
- Consider impact on other features

### 3. Implement Fixes
- Fix syntax and logical errors
- Update dependencies if needed
- Correct configuration issues
- Repair broken imports/exports
- Restore missing files

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Test the specific fix
- Run full test suite if available
- Check for regression issues
- Validate core functionality still works

### 5. Verification
- Confirm the original issue is resolved
- Ensure no new issues were introduced
- Document what was fixed
- Suggest preventive measures

## Common Fix Patterns
- **Build Errors**: Missing dependencies, syntax errors, configuration
- **Runtime Errors**: Logic bugs, null references, async issues
- **Integration Issues**: API endpoints, database connections, third-party services
- **Deployment Issues**: Environment variables, build configurations, permissions

## Emergency Mode
If $ARGUMENTS contains "--emergency":
- Focus on critical functionality only
- Implement quick fixes over perfect solutions
- Prioritize system stability
- Create restoration point first

Fix the issue completely and make sure everything works!
