## Post-Deployment Management

<management_info>
  <updating_content>
    <title>Making Changes to Your Live App</title>
    <process>
      1. Make changes using Claude commands (like `/add-this-feature`)
      2. Test changes work correctly
      3. Run `/deploy-when-ready` again to update the live version
      4. Changes will be live within 2-3 minutes
    </process>
    <note>Your URL stays the same - only the content updates</note>
  </updating_content>
  
  <monitoring>
    <title>Keeping Track of Your App</title>
    <metrics>
      - Visitor statistics (if analytics added)
      - Loading performance
      - Uptime and availability
      - Mobile vs desktop usage
    </metrics>
    <access>Available through hosting platform dashboard</access>
  </monitoring>
  
  <maintenance>
    <title>Keeping Your App Healthy</title>
    <tasks>

## Error Handling

<error_scenarios>
  <scenario name="deployment-failed">
    <condition>Technical error during deployment process</condition>
    <response>
      Don't worry! Deployment failed, but this happens sometimes. Let me try a different approach:
      
      **What might have happened:**
      ‚Ä¢ Temporary hosting service issue
      ‚Ä¢ File size or configuration problem
      ‚Ä¢ Network connectivity issue
      
      **What I'm doing:**
      1. Switching to a different hosting platform
      2. Checking and fixing any file issues
      3. Trying the deployment again
      
      Your app will be live soon - technical hiccups like this are normal and always fixable!
    </response>
  </scenario>
  
  <scenario name="app-not-ready">
    <condition>App has critical issues that prevent deployment</condition>
    <response>
      I found some issues that should be fixed before going live:
      
      {{#each blocking_issues}}
      ‚ùå **{{this.category}}**: {{this.description}}
      {{/each}}
      
      **Good news**: These are all fixable! Let me handle them automatically:
      
      1. I'll run `/fix-whatever-is-broken` to resolve the issues
      2. Then I'll come back and deploy your app
      3. Everything will be working perfectly
      
      This just means your app will be even better when it goes live!
    </response>
  </scenario>
  
  <scenario name="performance-concerns">
    <condition>App works but has performance issues</condition>
    <response>
      Your app works great, but I noticed it could be faster. I can:
      
      **Option 1: Deploy Now** (Recommended)
      ‚Ä¢ Your app works perfectly and is ready for users
      ‚Ä¢ I can optimize performance after it's live
      ‚Ä¢ You can start sharing it immediately
      
      **Option 2: Optimize First**
      ‚Ä¢ I'll improve loading speeds before deployment
      ‚Ä¢ Takes an extra 5-10 minutes
      ‚Ä¢ Results in faster initial user experience
      
      What would you prefer? Most people choose to go live now and optimize later!
