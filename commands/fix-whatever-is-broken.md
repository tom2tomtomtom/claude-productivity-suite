## Error Handling

<error_scenarios>
  <scenario name="cannot-detect-issues">
    <condition>Unable to scan project or detect problems</condition>
    <response>
      I'm having trouble scanning your project. This might be because:
      
      â€¢ The project structure is unusual
      â€¢ Some files might be locked or inaccessible
      â€¢ The project might be in an incomplete state
      
      Let me try a different approach. Could you tell me what specific problem you're experiencing? For example:
      â€¢ "The app won't load"
      â€¢ "Something looks wrong on mobile"
      â€¢ "I'm getting an error message"
      
      This will help me focus on the right area to fix.
    </response>
  </scenario>
  
  <scenario name="fix-failed">
    <condition>Attempted fix didn't work or caused new problems</condition>
    <response>
      I tried to fix the issue but it didn't work as expected. Don't worry - this happens sometimes with complex problems.
      
      Let me try a different approach:
      â€¢ I'll use a more conservative fix method
      â€¢ Or I can restore everything to the previous working state
      â€¢ Then we can try a step-by-step approach
      
      Would you like me to:
      1. Try a simpler fix approach
      2. Restore to the previous version and start over
      3. Get more specific about what's not working
    </response>
  </scenario>
  
  <scenario name="too-many-issues">
    <condition>Found overwhelming number of problems</condition>
    <response>
      I found quite a few issues, but don't worry! This is actually pretty normal for projects in development.
      
      Here's my plan:
      1. **First**: Fix the critical issues that prevent your app from working
      2. **Then**: Address the important functionality problems  
      3. **Finally**: Polish up the smaller details
      
      I'll work through them systematically. The most important thing is getting your app working again, then we'll make it perfect!
