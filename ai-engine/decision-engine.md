# AI Decision Engine - Core Intelligence System

## Overview
The AI Decision Engine is the brain of the v3.0 system that makes all technical decisions automatically, allowing non-coders to build enterprise applications through natural language.

## Core Components

### 1. Tech Stack Selector
Automatically selects optimal technology stack based on:
- Application type (SaaS, e-commerce, internal tools, etc.)
- Scale requirements (users, data, traffic)
- Team capabilities 
- Deployment preferences
- Integration needs

### 2. Architecture Designer  
Designs system architecture including:
- Database schema and relationships
- API structure and endpoints
- Frontend component hierarchy
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Caching strategies
- Monitoring and logging

### 3. Feature Interpreter
Translates natural language requirements into:
- Specific technical implementations
- Database models and migrations
- API endpoints with validation
- Frontend components and workflows
- Integration requirements

### 4. Error Resolution Engine
Automatically fixes errors by:
- Analyzing error patterns and context
- Applying known solutions
- Testing fixes automatically
- Rolling back if fixes fail
- Learning from successful resolutions

### 5. Performance Optimizer
Continuously improves performance through:
- Query optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Caching implementation
- Database indexing
- Code splitting strategies

## Decision Matrix

### Application Type Detection
```
E-commerce indicators: "store", "shop", "buy", "sell", "cart", "payment"
→ Stack: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + Stripe

SaaS indicators: "subscription", "tenant", "organization", "billing"  
→ Stack: Next.js + PostgreSQL + Auth0 + Stripe

Internal Tools: "employee", "admin", "dashboard", "internal"
→ Stack: React + Express + PostgreSQL + JWT

Mobile Backend: "app", "mobile", "iOS", "Android", "API"
→ Stack: Express + MongoDB + JWT + AWS
```

### Complexity Assessment
```
Simple (1-10 users): SQLite + Simple auth
Medium (10-1000 users): PostgreSQL + OAuth
Complex (1000+ users): PostgreSQL + Microservices + Redis
```

### Security Requirements
```
Public app: Full security stack (HTTPS, CORS, validation, sanitization)
Internal tool: Basic auth + RBAC
Healthcare: HIPAA compliance additions
Finance: PCI DSS compliance additions
```

## Learning System

The engine learns from:
- Successful project patterns
- Error resolution outcomes  
- Performance optimization results
- User feedback and preferences
- Industry best practices

## Integration Points

- **Agent-OS**: Receives high-level planning decisions
- **Codebase-OS**: Applies code quality decisions
- **Testing Suite**: Determines testing strategies
- **Recovery System**: Provides rollback decisions
- **Templates**: Selects and customizes templates
