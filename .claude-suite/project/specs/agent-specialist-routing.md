## Overview

Complete the intelligent routing system that matches user requests to optimal specialist agents, enabling efficient task distribution and parallel execution with integrated token optimization.

## Problem Statement

**Current State (30% complete):**
- Basic agent foundation exists in `src/agents/`
- Simple routing logic in `src/core/intelligent-router.js`
- Manual agent selection without optimization
- No parallel execution coordination
- Missing routing decision audit trail

**Target State:**
- Intelligent request analysis and specialist matching
- Token-optimized routing decisions using our new TokenOptimizer
- Parallel execution when beneficial
- Comprehensive routing audit trail
- Integration with pattern learning system

## Success Metrics

- **Routing Accuracy**: 90%+ correct specialist selection
- **Token Efficiency**: 40%+ reduction through optimized routing
- **Parallel Execution**: 60%+ faster completion for multi-domain tasks
- **User Satisfaction**: "I got exactly the right help" feedback
- **System Learning**: Routing improves over time through pattern recognition

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Intelligent Router (`src/core/intelligent-router.js`)
```javascript
class IntelligentRouter {
  // Current: Basic routing logic
  // Target: AI-powered routing with token optimization
  
  async routeRequest(userRequest, context) {
    // Analyze request complexity and domain requirements
    // Use TokenOptimizer to evaluate routing costs
    // Select optimal specialist(s) with confidence scores
    // Generate routing decision audit trail
  }
  
  async executeParallelRouting(routingPlan) {
    // Coordinate multiple specialists
    // Manage inter-agent communication
    // Optimize token usage across parallel executions
  }
}
```

#### 2. Routing Decision Engine
```javascript
class RoutingDecisionEngine {
  analyzeRequestDomains(userRequest) {
    // Extract technical domains: frontend, backend, database, etc.
    // Identify complexity levels and interdependencies
    // Return domain confidence scores
  }
  
  optimizeSpecialistSelection(domains, context) {
    // Use TokenOptimizer patterns for cost-efficient selection
    // Consider specialist availability and expertise levels
    // Factor in user context and project history
  }
}
```

#### 3. Parallel Execution Coordinator
```javascript
class ParallelExecutionCoordinator {
  async coordinateSpecialists(routingPlan) {
    // Manage specialist lifecycle and communication
    // Handle inter-agent data sharing
    // Coordinate completion and result aggregation
  }
}
```

### Integration Points

#### With TokenOptimizer
- Use `VibeExecutionPlanner` for routing cost estimation
- Leverage `OptimizationCache` for similar routing decisions
- Apply `OptimizationStatsManager` for routing performance tracking

#### With Existing Agents
- Enhance `src/agents/base-agent.js` with routing compatibility
- Upgrade specialist agents with parallel execution support
- Add routing feedback loop for continuous improvement

### Data Structures

#### Routing Request
```javascript
{
  userRequest: "build a blog with user authentication",
  context: { userType, technicalLevel, constraints },
  domains: {
    frontend: { confidence: 0.9, complexity: "medium" },
    backend: { confidence: 0.8, complexity: "high" },
    database: { confidence: 0.6, complexity: "low" }
  },
  parallelizable: true,
  estimatedTokens: 2500
}
```

#### Routing Decision
```javascript
{
  primarySpecialist: "backend",
  supportingSpecialists: ["frontend", "database"],
  executionPlan: {
    phase1: ["backend"], // Authentication setup
    phase2: ["frontend", "database"], // UI and data layer (parallel)
    phase3: ["backend"] // Integration
  },
  tokenOptimization: {
    baseline: 2500,
    optimized: 1600,
    savings: 36
  },
  decisionFactors: ["domain_confidence", "token_efficiency", "parallel_benefits"]
}
```
