## 2025-07-30: Non-Coder First Design Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Product Strategy

### Decision
Design all workflows and interfaces primarily for non-coders, with technical users as secondary audience.

### Context
Target users are single-person non-coders who want to build applications but are intimidated by technical complexity. Traditional development tools assume coding knowledge.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Ultra-simple command interface reduces barrier to entry
- Natural language workflows make development accessible
- Focus on end results rather than technical implementation

**Trade-offs:**
- May seem "dumbed down" to experienced developers
- Requires more intelligent abstraction layers
- Documentation must be extremely clear and jargon-free

## 2025-07-30: Documentation-Driven Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Implemented  
**Category:** Technical

### Decision
Use Markdown documentation as the primary method for defining workflows, agents, and system behavior.

### Context
Non-coders need to understand what the system does. Code-based configurations are intimidating and opaque.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Complete transparency - users can read exactly what happens
- Easy to modify workflows without programming
- Self-documenting system architecture
- Version control friendly

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires parsing layer to convert markdown to executable logic
- May be slower than direct code execution
- Requires discipline to keep documentation accurate

## 2025-07-30: Agent Specialist Model

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Technical

### Decision
Create specialist AI agents for different domains (frontend, backend, database, etc.) rather than one general-purpose agent.

### Context
Different coding tasks require different expertise. A general agent may give suboptimal advice or waste tokens on irrelevant context.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- More accurate, focused solutions for specific problems
- Reduced token usage through targeted expertise
- Faster problem resolution through specialization
- Easier to improve individual domains

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires intelligent routing to select correct agent
- More complex system architecture
- Need to maintain multiple agent personalities/expertise

## 2025-07-30: Learning from Mistakes Priority

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Planned
**Category:** Intelligence

### Decision
Implement comprehensive mistake learning system that prevents repeated errors and suggests improvements.

### Context
Non-coders will make similar mistakes repeatedly. Learning from errors and proactively preventing them will improve user experience and reduce frustration.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Dramatically improved user experience over time
- Reduced support burden through prevention
- System gets smarter with each interaction
- Users build confidence through guided success

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires sophisticated error categorization
- Storage and processing overhead for learning data
- Complex algorithm to match patterns and suggest improvements

## 2025-07-30: Token Efficiency as Core Metric

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Planned
**Category:** Performance

### Decision
Make token usage reduction a primary success metric, targeting 50%+ reduction through intelligent patterns.

### Context
High token usage makes Claude Code expensive for regular use. Non-coders need affordable access to build applications.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- More accessible pricing for individual builders
- Faster responses due to smaller context windows
- Forces intelligent design of compression and caching
- Sustainable for long development sessions

**Trade-offs:**
- May require sacrificing some context for efficiency
- Complex optimization algorithms needed
- Risk of over-optimization reducing quality
