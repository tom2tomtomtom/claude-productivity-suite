## Quality Gates by Development Phase

### Planning Phase
- [ ] User vision clearly captured and confirmed
- [ ] Technical approach selected matches user needs
- [ ] Realistic timeline and expectations set
- [ ] Success criteria defined in user terms

### Development Phase  
- [ ] Regular progress check-ins with user
- [ ] Features built match planned specifications
- [ ] User can see and understand progress
- [ ] Error handling works smoothly when issues arise

### Testing Phase
- [ ] User validates functionality matches their vision
- [ ] App works reliably across different scenarios
- [ ] Performance meets user expectations
- [ ] All planned features are present and working

### Deployment Phase

## Failure Recovery Protocols

### When Quality Gates Fail

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Stop current approach** - Don't continue building if quality gates fail
2. **Assess gap** - Understand specifically what's not meeting standards
3. **Communicate clearly** - Explain issue to user in simple terms
4. **Propose solutions** - Offer clear options for moving forward

#### Recovery Strategies
- **Feature Mismatch**: Show current vs expected, rebuild specific parts
- **Technical Issues**: Switch to simpler, more reliable approaches
- **User Confusion**: Reduce complexity, increase explanation detail
- **Token Budget**: Compress context, prioritize essential features
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize critical paths, defer nice-to-have features

#### Learning Integration
- **Update Patterns**: Add successful recovery approaches to knowledge base
- **Prevent Recurrence**: Implement checks to catch similar issues earlier
- **Improve Routing**: Adjust agent selection based on failure analysis
- **Enhance Prediction**: Better anticipate potential failure points
