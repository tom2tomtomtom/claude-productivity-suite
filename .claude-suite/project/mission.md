## Vision
Create the world's best process for using Claude Code that enables non-coders to build professional applications through "vibe coding" - natural language descriptions that get intelligently transformed into working software with maximum cost efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Non-coders want to build applications but face barriers:
- Traditional development processes don't match how non-coders think and communicate
- Claude Code token costs can get expensive without optimization
- No systematic way to turn "vibes" into working code
- Missing process for .md XML command files integration
- Need seamless workflow between natural language and technical implementation

## Target Users
**Primary**: Non-coder "vibe coders" who:
- Have app ideas but no coding skills
- Want to describe what they want in natural language
- Need cost-effective development solutions
- Value simplicity over technical control

**Secondary**: Developers seeking ultra-efficient Claude Code workflows

## Success Metrics
- Token usage reduction of 50%+ through intelligent patterns
- 90%+ success rate for non-coder app building
- Learning system prevents 80%+ of repeated mistakes
- Agent specialist routing improves efficiency by 60%+
- User confidence increases from "intimidated" to "empowered"

## Core Principles
1. **Vibe Coding First**: If you can describe your vibe, we can build your app
2. **Cost Optimization**: Minimize Claude Code token usage without sacrificing quality
3. **.md XML Integration**: Seamless process between command files and implementation
4. **Agent Specialists**: Mix of implemented and planned specialist routing
5. **Learn & Adapt**: Target patterns and metrics drive continuous improvement

## Core Philosophy
"The world's best process for using Claude Code - transforming vibes into apps without breaking the bank."
