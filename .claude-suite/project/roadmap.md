## Phase 0: Already Completed âœ…

The following foundation has been implemented:

- [x] **CLI Framework** - Interactive command processing with natural language interpretation (src/index.js:23-424)
- [x] **Agent Architecture** - Base agent system with specialist routing foundation (src/agents/, src/core/)
- [x] **Session Management** - Context preservation and user session handling (src/core/session-manager.js)
- [x] **Health Monitoring** - System diagnostics and performance tracking (src/core/health-monitor.js)
- [x] **Token Optimization Engine** - Pattern recognition and compression core (src/core/context-compression-engine.js)
- [x] **Command Processing** - Natural language to command mapping (src/core/command-processor.js)
- [x] **Basic Suite Structure** - Initial .claude-suite directory with project context
- [x] **Playwright Testing** - E2E testing framework integration (package.json:9,41)

## Phase 1: Current Development ðŸš§

- [ ] **.md XML Command Files Integration** - Seamless workflow between command files and implementation
  - Status: 70% complete
  - Focus: Making .md XML commands work together as unified process
  - Files: commands/*.md contain structured command definitions

- [ ] **Agent Specialists Implementation** - Complete the specialist agent system  
  - Status: 30% complete (some implemented, some planned per user feedback)
  - Blocking: Need to finish command routing logic
  - Files: src/agents/ has foundation, needs specialist completion

- [ ] **Vibe Coding Engine** - Natural language to professional app pipeline
  - Status: 50% complete (basic interpretation in src/index.js:132-155)
  - Transform user "vibes" into structured development tasks

## Phase 2: Next Up ðŸ“‹

- [ ] **Agent Specialist Routing** - Intelligent task-to-agent matching
- [ ] **Success Pattern Library** - Pre-built solutions for common non-coder needs
- [ ] **Visual Progress Dashboard** - Real-time feedback for non-technical users
- [ ] **One-Command App Building** - Single command to complete applications

## Phase 3: Future Vision ðŸ”®

- [ ] **Natural Language Programming** - Describe what you want, get working app
- [ ] **Predictive Workflow Suggestions** - AI suggests next steps based on patterns
- [ ] **Community Pattern Sharing** - Learn from global non-coder successes
- [ ] **Voice-Driven Development** - Build apps through conversation

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Ultra-Simple Commands
Transform complex workflows into single, intuitive commands:
```bash
/build-my-app "food delivery for my neighborhood"
/fix-whatever-is-broken
/make-it-look-better
/deploy-when-ready
```

### 2. Smart Token Management
- Pattern recognition to avoid repetitive explanations
- Context compression without losing understanding
- Intelligent routing to minimize unnecessary processing

### 3. Mistake Prevention
- Error pattern recognition
- Proactive suggestion system
- Recovery recommendations based on similar past issues
