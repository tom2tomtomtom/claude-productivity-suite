## 🎯 Phase-Based Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish testing and reduce complexity
- **Focus**: Critical priority tasks (testing framework + refactoring)
- **Target**: Health score 72/100
- **Key Wins**: Jest setup, token-optimizer.js refactored

### Phase 2: Cleanup (Weeks 3-4)  
**Goal**: Clean logging and update dependencies
- **Focus**: High priority tasks (logging + dependencies)
- **Target**: Health score 78/100
- **Key Wins**: Zero console.logs, updated packages

### Phase 3: Quality (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Organization and documentation
- **Focus**: Medium priority tasks (structure + docs)
- **Target**: Health score 82/100
- **Key Wins**: 80% test coverage, clean organization

### Phase 4: Excellence (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Security and performance
- **Focus**: Low priority tasks (security + performance)
- **Target**: Health score 85/100
- **Key Wins**: Security hardening, optimizations

## 📊 Success Metrics & Celebration Points

### 🎉 Milestone Celebrations
Track these wins in `progress.md`:

- **🎯 First Quick Win** (Day 1): Complete any quick win task

### 📈 Weekly Health Score Targets
```
Week 1: 68 → 70 (Foundation setup)
Week 2: 70 → 72 (Testing + complexity)
Week 3: 72 → 75 (Logging cleanup)
Week 4: 75 → 78 (Dependencies + organization)
Week 5: 78 → 82 (Coverage + documentation)
Week 6: 82 → 85 (Security + performance)
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Check for vulnerabilities  
npm audit

# Update dependencies (carefully!)
npm update

# Clean up console.logs (example)
grep -r "console.log" src/ --include="*.js"
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
# Before committing improvements:
npm test                    # All tests pass
npm run lint               # No linting errors  
npm audit                  # No vulnerabilities
git status                 # Clean working directory
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 🎯 Maintain Momentum
- **Start small**: Quick wins build confidence
- **Work in priority order**: Critical → High → Medium → Low
- **Test everything**: Never break existing functionality
- **Celebrate progress**: Update progress.md after each session

### 🔧 Technical Best Practices
- **One thing at a time**: Complete subtasks sequentially
- **Test after changes**: Run `npm test` frequently
- **Commit often**: Small commits with clear messages
- **Reference standards**: Follow links to best practices

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't skip testing setup**: Foundation enables everything else
- **Don't batch console.log fixes**: Do one file at a time
- **Don't update all dependencies at once**: Test each update
- **Don't ignore failing tests**: Fix immediately
