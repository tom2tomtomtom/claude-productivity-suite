## Simple Commands for Non-Coders

### üöÄ Start Building

```bash
/fix-whatever-is-broken
```
**What it does:** Automatically finds and fixes errors, explains what went wrong
**When to use:** Anytime something doesn't work

/make-it-look-better
/add-this-feature "describe new feature"
/test-everything
```
**What they do:**

## Learning System Integration

### Mistake Prevention
- System remembers what caused problems before
- Automatically suggests better approaches
- Warns before you make common mistakes

### Pattern Learning
- Learns what you like (colors, layouts, features)
- Suggests improvements based on successful apps
- Adapts to your building style over time

### Token Optimization
- Remembers your preferences to avoid re-explaining
- Uses smart shortcuts for common requests
- Compresses technical details you don't need to see

## Success Indicators

### ‚úÖ Good Session
- App builds without errors
- Features work as expected  
- You understand what was built
- Progress feels smooth and encouraging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
- Multiple error cycles
- Confusion about what's happening
- Features don't match your vision
- Feeling frustrated or lost

### üéØ Optimization Opportunities
- Same questions asked repeatedly
- Similar apps built multiple times
- Common error patterns detected
- Token usage higher than optimal
