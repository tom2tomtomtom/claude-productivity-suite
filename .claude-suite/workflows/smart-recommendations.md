## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Command Sequences

### For Complete Beginners (Never Built An App)
```bash
# Step 1: Start with your idea
/build-my-app "your app idea here"

# Step 2: Check progress and understand what's happening  
/show-me-progress

# Step 3: If anything breaks, fix it automatically
/fix-whatever-is-broken

# Step 4: Make it look professional
/make-it-look-better

# Step 5: Test everything works
/test-everything

# Step 6: Put it online for others to use
/deploy-when-ready
```

### For Building Your Second App (Learning Mode)
```bash
# Step 1: See what the system learned about you
/intelligence-dashboard

# Step 2: Build using your learned patterns
/build-my-app "new app idea"

# Step 3: Apply optimizations from previous experience
/optimize-tokens

# Step 4: Continue with standard workflow
/show-me-progress â†’ /make-it-look-better â†’ /deploy-when-ready
```

### For Improving An Existing App
```bash
# Step 1: Understand current state
/analyze-codebase

# Step 2: Add your new feature
/add-this-feature "describe what you want to add"

# Step 3: Make sure everything still works
/test-everything

# Step 4: Deploy improvements
/deploy-when-ready
```

### When Things Go Wrong
```bash
# First, try automatic fix
/fix-whatever-is-broken

# If still having issues, get detailed help
/intelligence-dashboard

# For complex problems, route to right specialist
/route-to-specialist "describe the problem"

# Reset and try simpler approach if needed
/start-over-simpler
```

## ðŸ§  Intelligent Recommendations System

### Context-Aware Suggestions
The system analyzes your current situation and recommends the best next command:

#### New User Indicators
- **Detected**: First time using system, no previous projects
- **Recommended Start**: `/build-my-app` with detailed guidance
- **Next Steps**: Progress checking and visual feedback prioritized

#### Returning User Indicators  
- **Detected**: Previous successful projects, learned preferences
- **Recommended Start**: `/intelligence-dashboard` then optimized workflows
- **Next Steps**: Pattern reuse and efficiency optimization

#### Error State Indicators

## ðŸ”„ Adaptive Recommendations

### Learning From User Behavior
- **Track Command Success**: Which sequences work best for each user
- **Identify Patterns**: Common failure points and successful approaches
- **Personalize Flow**: Adapt recommendations to user's learning style
- **Optimize Experience**: Reduce friction and increase success rates

### Dynamic Adjustment
- **Real-time Analysis**: Adjust recommendations based on current session
- **Context Awareness**: Consider project type, user experience, time constraints
- **Error Adaptation**: Modify approach when standard recommendations fail
- **Success Reinforcement**: Repeat successful patterns for similar users

### Confidence Indicators
- **ðŸŸ¢ High Confidence (90%+)**: Clear user intent, proven workflow path
- **ðŸŸ¡ Medium Confidence (70-89%)**: Multiple good options, user choice needed
- **ðŸ”´ Low Confidence (<70%)**: Unclear intent, request clarification

## ðŸ’¡ Smart Suggestions in Action

### Example Interaction
```
USER: "I want to build something but I'm not sure what"

SYSTEM RECOMMENDATION:
ðŸŽ¯ Perfect! Let's start with some inspiration.

NEXT COMMAND: /build-my-app "something simple like a personal website or small business page"

Why this first? 
âœ“ Gets you building immediately
âœ“ Simple enough to ensure success
âœ“ Teaches the process for future projects

Would you prefer to:
1. Build a personal website to learn the basics
2. Create something for a hobby or interest
3. Start with a simple business idea

Just say what sounds interesting and I'll handle the rest!
```

### Contextual Guidance
```
USER: [After first app is built] "This is great! What should I do now?"

SYSTEM RECOMMENDATION:
ðŸŽ‰ Awesome! You've got your first working app. Here's what I recommend:

NEXT COMMAND: /make-it-look-better

Why this next?
âœ“ Quick visual win that feels satisfying
âœ“ Teaches you about design improvements
âœ“ Makes your app more professional

After that, we'll do:
â†’ /test-everything (make sure it all works)
â†’ /deploy-when-ready (put it online for others!)

Ready to make it look amazing?
